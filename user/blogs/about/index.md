## Introduction
Hi, I'm Harsh Agrawal, a teenage full stack developer and student based in India. I have a passion for technology and have been coding for the past two years. I got interested in full stack development after trying my hand at app and game development, but I found that my true calling was in web development. I am now capable of handling web projects that match those of many college graduates and I am thrilled to be a part of this ever-evolving tech world.

## My journey
it's been two years since i am coding, the time passed by without letting me realize.
i am thrilled to be part of the constantly evolving tech industry. It's a little bad to constantly change your tech stacks in full stack development, but the knowledge you get, and more better dev you become is worth it.

## Current Tech Stack
Right now, I'm particularly interested in a tech stack that includes Pocketbase, Express, Svelte, and Node.js - otherwise known as PESN. Although Pocketbase is still in its early stages, I have high hopes for its potential as a database solution for smaller or production-level projects. And of course, when it comes to more established databases, I also have experience using MongoDB.

## Some Advice
It's common for new developers to feel discouraged or even quit when comparing themselves to others who may seem to be achieving success more quickly. However, it's important to remember that everyone has their own unique skills and journeys in the tech industry. Success in software development doesn't come overnight, and it's crucial to stay focused on your own goals and put in the hard work. Don't be discouraged by others success, as it's not a reflection of your own potential. Embrace your own strengths and pace, and have faith in the power of hard work and dedication to eventually achieve your goals. Whether it takes a little longer or not, what truly matters is that you keep pushing forward and never give up on your dreams.

## Bye! Have a nice day!
