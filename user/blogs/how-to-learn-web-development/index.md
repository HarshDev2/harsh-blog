Maybe you are a beginner or maybe already have a lil bit of knowledge
about web development but struggling about what to do now, this situation is quite common in new devs..

## Starting Up
If you have choosen that you want to go with web development, then I
think the best thing you can do is start learning **HTML**, it's a quite easier markup language with angle brackets `<>` and very easy syntax like this:

```html
<p>I am a Paragraph</p>
```

I don't think that would really take more than a week to master in HTML, once it's done..

you can countinue your learning journey with **CSS**, again a markup language with power to make things beautiful, maybe you have understood it is used to style our web page.

Let's see it's syntax:
```css
.item {
    color: pink;
    background-color: white;
}
```
HTML, CSS plays a important role in web development, even you become master at web development, you will have to use these both at some parts of th web, i think you will be able to create atleast a good looking small web page by learning these two.

## Continuing with Javascript
But that's not the end there's alot to go, now you have to learn a programming language, you would be confused to know that html, css are not programming languages, they are markup langs, but the lang you have to learn is **JavaScript**.

> Without JavaScript, the life of a web dev is like a painting without colors..

Once you will learn it, you will be not able to live without coding with it, It's a quite beginners friendly language so you will have fun learning it..

the next thing you can probably do is [Install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) in your computer and start making use of it..

You can become familiar with commands like -
```bash
/// showLineNumber
node <file>
npm install <package>
npm run <command>
```

## The next big Step
if you have came here, now it's time to be introduced to the real web development world, it's time to start with a web framework like [Svelte](https://svelte.dev), [React](https://reactjs.org), [Vue](https://vuejs.org), [Angular](https://angular.io) and many more..

I think you can start with svelte because it's the most loved framework for web development, but you should start with ReactJS as a student's prospective.

## Starting Backend Development
> oh, that far? amazing! let's go with backend development..

I think now you would have an app working amazingly but now, with backend development you can make your app more accessible by using **databases for data storing**, **user authentication** and much more things..<br>
now, you should learn to use [MongoDB](https://mongodb.com/) or any SQL Database(if you choose sql databases you will have to maybe learn a new language named SQL also), I think it's best to go with NoSQL Databases at first for beginners, and you can have other options like [Firebase](https://firebase.com/) or [SupaBase](https://supabase.com/) with **MongoDB** in NoSQL Databases and [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) or [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) in SQL Databases, i don't recommend sql databases..

Intergrate your backend database with backend softwares for web development like [Express](https://expressjs.com/) for Vanilla JS, or if you have choosed Svelte, you can go with [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev), for React you can go with [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/), and [Nuxt](https://nuxtjs.org/) for Vue, Angular and Astro don't need extra js with them.

after learning all these, i don't think at that time you will need any guide to help you, you could decide youself what to do next!

Bye! Happy Coding!
